# Book 2 - The Invisible Web

In this book, you will learn some fundamental concepts and skills in writing the logic and operations that power modern websites in the JavaScript language. The first three months at Nashville Software School focuses almost exclusively on building applications for the browser with JavaScript.

Making as much progress on JavaScript is **critical** to your success early in the course.

        <p class="listItem__header">Part 1</p>
        <p>Visit the the Codecademy platform and take their Introduction to JavaScript course. You only need to work through chapters 1-8 in the free tier material. <strong>Please do not sign up for any paid version of Codecademy</strong>. </p>

    <li class="listItem listItem--doubleItems">
        <p class="listItem__header">Part 2</p>
        <p>The next step is to learn more about data structures. This is Core Knowledge that an web application developer needs to have, so you need to know the fundamental vocabulary and have some exposure to them before NSS.</p>

        <p>As a beginner, you will make plenty of syntactic mistakes when you write code. It's normal and natural as you learn a new language. Learning how to debug (fix mistakes) code is a critical skill. </p>

    <li class="listItem listItem--doubleItems">
        <p class="listItem__header">Part 4</p>
        <p>Now that you have learned the basics of writing and debugging JavaScript, you can watch an experienced developer review some of the concepts, and try your hand at some interactive challenges.</p>
