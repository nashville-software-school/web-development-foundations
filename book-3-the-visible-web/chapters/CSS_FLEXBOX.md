# Layouts With Flexbox

Flexbox is a CSS tool you can use to build flexible layouts in your HTML page.

In this part of the Foundations Course, you will be watching an interactive video, but you can also interact with it. If you pause the playback while you are watching, you can start typing in code into the editor and you will immediately see the results in the integrated web browser.

## Assignment

Take every opportunity to try the CSS yourself when the narrator asks you to pause and try the code yourself.

Watch the [Learn Flexbox](https://scrimba.com/g/gflexbox) interactive video series about the basics of using Flexbox to create flexible, scalable layouts in an HTML page.
